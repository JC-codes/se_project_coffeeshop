# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I believe a little more animation would make the project more appealing visually and be a fun challenge to code. I think a steaming coffee cup would be a nice visual on the menu page as well as a fun challenge to code.
